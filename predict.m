function p = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X)
%PREDICT Predict the label of an input given a trained neural network

% Useful values
m = size(X, 1);
num_labels = size(Theta2, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly 
p = zeros(size(X, 1), 1);

%  p - vector of labels between 1 to num_labels.
%
% max function might come in useful. In particular, the max
%       function can also return the index of the max element, for more
%       information see 'help max'. 
% If  examples are in rows use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max for each row.

% to do, in next commit predicting with Theta1 and Theta2
